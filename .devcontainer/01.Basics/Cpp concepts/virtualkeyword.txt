Virtual keyword is used when we want same function name but defination of that may change in future

in derived class and to tell compilier do not link the defination of vitual function at compile time.

 A C++ virtual function is a member function in the base class that you redefine in a derived class. It
 is declared using the virtual keyword. 
 It is used to tell the compiler to perform dynamic linkage or late binding on the function.
